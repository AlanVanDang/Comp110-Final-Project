# My-Sample-Code
These files were my projects for Comp110. Both projects used Python and the 1st project also used Jupyter Notebook.
Project 1 was him giving us a list of information and we had to select certain information we wanted to investigate.
My project 2 was me making a game. He gave us no codes beforehand, just the requirements for the game like adding emojis, a point tracker, and implement randomness.
